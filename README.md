# From-Zero-to-AI

Welcome to my learning playground for **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**. This repository is a living notebook of everything I study, build, break, fix, and rebuild while journeying from fundamentals to advanced AI.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo serves as:

* A personal learning archive
* A collection of experiments, notes, and projects
* A space to document my progress in ML & DL
* A reference for concepts I’ve learned along the way

## 🧩 What’s Inside

You’ll find:

* Python notebooks
* Implementations of ML/DL algorithms
* Concept notes and explanations
* Mini-projects and experiments
* Practice problems and solutions

## 🌱 Learning Path (evolving)

* Mathematics for ML
* Python & Data Science
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Model building & experimentation

## 📌 Note

This repository grows as I learn. Some code may be rough, some polished — but all of it reflects the journey from **zero to AI**.
